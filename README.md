DevSearch is a simple website built with Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The purpose of the website is to let developers around the world share the projects they are working on and let other devs see them! In order to do this, we've created a simple management system that allows users to create profiles and projects.

We're currently running DevSearch at https://devsearch-website-production.up.railway.app/, so check it out if you want to see what we're all about!
